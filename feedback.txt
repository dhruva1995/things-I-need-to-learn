My feedback over practise	

1. Complete Algorithms course part-2.

2. Need a through preparation over permutation and combination (Not a begineer level but an Expert level preparation).	
For getting started https://www.udemy.com/dontmemorise_permutations_combinations/learn/v4/overview	
If you are really serious of solving this take this http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Clase/EC/ec.html or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCJNjW8kMIg&app=desktop	

3. Learn Graph theory and Advanced Graph theory courses in NPTEL.

4. I need to learn Partitions this is getting tricky for me.
